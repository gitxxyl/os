# [redacted]os
_NOTE: This kernel is still in early stages of development - check back after a few months to see a potentially usable OS._
_It lacks proper documentation and a proper license, but for now, just don't copy anything from here without asking me._

[redacted]os is a hobbyist OS on x86_64. Feel free to contribute (although I'm really bad at git, and I'm not exactly sure why you would want to).

What I'm working on right now:
* Filesystem

What I'm going to work on soon:
* Processes / multithreaded context
 
The current goal is to get DOOM running on this OS. Beyond that, I'm not really sure right now. 
I might not commit to this repo that often, but I'll try. 

# why 
I like making stuff and this is a lot of stuff to make.

...along with a healthy touch of procrastinating on far more important work.

# who 
For now, it's just me.
