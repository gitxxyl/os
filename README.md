# [redacted]os
[redacted]os - a hobbyist x86_64 operating system kernel.
_NOTE: This kernel is still in early stages of development - check back after a few months to see a potentially usable OS._
_It lacks proper documentation and a proper license, but for now, just don't copy anything from here without asking me._
To know what [redacted] is or for other queries, add me on discord: xxyl#3636.

This OS is built on the Limine bootloader and loaded in long mode, higher half.

Major features in the works right now:
 * Memory management 
 * Filesystem
 
The current goal is to get DOOM running on this OS. Beyond that, I'm not really sure right now. 
I might not commit to this repo that often, but I'll try.
