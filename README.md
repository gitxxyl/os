# [redacted]os
_NOTE: This kernel is still in early stages of development - check back after a few months to see a potentially usable OS._
_It lacks proper documentation and a proper license, but for now, just don't copy anything from here without asking me._

[redacted]os is a hobbyist OS currently only on x86_64. feel free to contribute if you want.

What I'm working on right now:
* Filesystem
* Processes / multithreaded context
 
Long term goal: run doom! (https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric)

# why 
i like making stuff and this is a lot of stuff to make.

# how to run ?!!1!!
to build the .iso, you need:
* make 
* xorriso 
* nasm
* gcc and ld

and to run on qemu:
* ovmf
* qemu (qemu-system-x86_64)

you can get all of this on apt if you're using debian.
# who 
for now, it's just me.
